            <h2>Saving the future by serving today</h2>
            <p>We give new hope to not only children but also to parents who cannot abily support their 
                children to go to school.
                We started the school in 2015 with 20 pupils and to current date the numbers are growing to over
                200 pupils.                
            </p>
            {/* <p>What keeps us going is seeing the children achieve more through high performances in school. Our school
                got 2 first grades in Primary Leaving exams. This is an achievement because we have very few staff. 
                We work hard and pray hard and effectively utilise every little resource we have. 
            </p> */}
            {/* <p>
                Tis performance also ranks us third in the village schools around us. This is another suprising factor
                because most of the schools arond us are private schools. We are therefore grateful to God for blessing
                our mission, to our parents for trusting us with their children, we are also grateful to the staff for working 
                so tirelessly and to the community for continously supporting us.
            </p> */}
